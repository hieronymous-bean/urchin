## Introduction
Urchin was developed to give beginner developers a way to quickly create a front-end interface without having to comb through hundreds of lines of source code and insert their own information. Using Urchin, all a user needs to do is update the configuration file with their preferred settings and run the setup command. Urchin takes care of the rest, and builds a fully-populated set of files that are ready-to-use and easy to understand. 




## System Requirements

At its core, Urchin relies on Node.js and NPM for its core functionality. 

- Node.js ~14.15.0
- NPM ~6.14.8

Urchin uses a core set of packages for its functionality:

*Focus*                             |  *Tool(s)*
------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Engine                              | Node.js
Primary Functions                   | Javascript
Build and Deployment Automation     | Gulp
View Engine                         | Pug
Front-End                           | Bootstrap
Styling                             | SCSS

## :inbox_tray: Quick Start

To get started, first go to the `config.json` file and edit the configuration objects, adding your personal information and application build preferences. A full list of configuration options and their expected values will be provided later. 

Then, run the setup script from the root directory to build the application and load all required assets.

```
npm run setup
```

This will install all required modules, run Gulp task automation, and compile application components. It also compiles all Pug templates into their HTML equivalents, with all variables prep-populated with the data entered in `config.json`.
